# Analyzing-Boston-Cab-Data


Project Descriptions: In today’s era for our daily transit we are heavily dependent upon online cab services like Uber and Lyft. But isn’t it strange that sometimes we get cab for lower rate and sometimes it is very high, it would be so great if we can understand what causes this price surge and by how much?

Data Source: dataset taken from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma 

Project Requirements: We have used Python for Data Analysis and tableau for the both Analysis and Visualization.

Project Results:
We got some interesting Insights such as
• Temperature affects the average price per mile for both Uber and Lyft and it is positively
correlated.

• Uber pool is expensive than the Lyft shared ride.

• Uber was expensive than Lyft in the month of November and December.

• Average Price was high on Friday and followed by Saturday.

• Time of a day and day of a week has effect on cab prices
